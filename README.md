<h1>SAVE THE MEAL</h1>
<h3>Multipages responsive website with React</h3>

<p>Born on the desire to improve the food system and ensure food security, Save the Meal is a company* that produces plant-based foods. This project is a multipage website that advertises the company and its products. <p>
  <br>
<p>The website consists of a Landing Page - Home -, three other pages** (1. Foods - where visitor can explore the details and benefits of the products; 2. Store - an e-commerce where to order and buy the products that you like; 3. Recipes - a database of many plant-based recipes that visitor can follow when they need some inspirations in the kitchen). In addiction, the released of an extra session is scheduled - "Don't waste it, Taste it!" - which is a web app that keeps track of the users' pantry and based on the ingredients' availability suggests recipes from the Save the Meal's database. </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>* Save the Meal is not a real company. I created this fake company out of 1. my desire to use technology to redesign the food system; 2. my vocation to keep animals out of the plates. </li>
  <li>** These pages are still under construction.</li>
  </ul>
